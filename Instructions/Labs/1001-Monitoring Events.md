## Summary

In this lab, you will learn how to manage Windows 10 event logs and configure Event log subscriptions.

## Exercise 1: Manage Windows 10 Event Logs

### Scenario

You need to perform maintenance tasks on the Event logs for SEA-CL1. You will first review the event log entries for the Application, Security, and System logs. You will then configure the Maximum log size for the Application and System event logs. Finally, you will configure the Security event log to Archive the log when full and do not overwrite events.

### Task 1: Review Event Log entries

2. Select **Start**, and then type **Event Viewer**.

3. In the search results, select the **Event Viewer** app. The Event Viewer opens.

4. Maximize the Event Viewer window.

5. Under Event Viewer (Local), expand **Windows Logs**.

6. Under Windows Logs, select **Application** and then scroll through the reported events. Take note of the various events listed for the Application log. You may have a combination of Information, Warning, and Error events.

7. Under Windows Logs, select **Security** and then scroll through the reported events. Take note of the events listed for the Security log. Most of these events are security related based upon Microsoft Windows security auditing.

8. Under Windows Logs, select **System** and then scroll through the reported events. Take note of the various events listed for the System log. You may have a combination of Information, Warning, and Error events related to internal Windows system services.

## Exercise 2: Configure and Manage Event Subscriptions  

### Scenario

SEA-CL2 is a critical workstation that needs to be monitored and maintained on a regular basis. To efficiently monitor SEA-CL2, you decide to collect its event log entries so that you can review them on your workstation named SEA-CL1. To perform this task, you need to assign permissions on SEA-CL2. You will then create a "Collector Initiated" event log subscription on your workstation that connects to SEA-CL2 and collects the last 30 days of event log entries.

### Task 1: Configure Event Log Subscriptions

1. Sign in to **SEA-CL2** as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

12. In the **Event Log Readers Properties** dialog box, select **OK**.

13. Close the **Computer Management** window.

14. Switch to **SEA-CL1** and sign in as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

15. Right-click **Start**, and then select **Windows PowerShell (Admin)**.

16. At the PowerShell command prompt, type the following command, and then press **Enter**:

```
