## Exercise 2: Protect Additional Data

### Scenario

An additional request has been made to protect specific files being added to SEA-CL2. A script has been provided named CopyUserData.bat to be used to create the intended folders and copy the required data. The *Data* folder needs to be added to the document library, but both the *Data* and *Reports* folder must both be protected by File History.

### Task 1: Run the CopyUserData script

2. In the content pane, double-click **CopyUserData** to copy lab files to the local client.

3. In File Explorer, in the navigation pane, expand **Local Disk (C:)**, and then select **Data**. In the details pane, right-click **Sales.txt**, select **Properties**, select the **Previous Versions** tab, confirm that there are no previous versions available, and then select **OK**.

### Task 2: Configure Additional Folders

1. In the navigation pane, right-click **Data**, select **Include in library**, and then select **Documents**. As File History protects the Documents library, File History is now also protecting the Data folder.

2. In File Explorer, in the navigation pane, select **Reports**. In the details pane, right-click **Report.txt**, select **Properties**, select the **Previous Versions** tab, confirm that there are no previous versions available, and then select **OK**.

3. On the taskbar, in the **Type here to search** box, enter **file history**, and then select **Backup settings**.

6. In the **File History** window, in the **File History is on** section, select **Run now**.

7. In File Explorer, in the details pane, right-click **Report.txt**, select **Properties**, select the **Previous Versions** tab, verify that there is now one previous version, and then select **OK**.

8. In the navigation pane, right-click **Data**, select **Properties**, select the **Previous Versions** tab, and then select **Data** in the **Folder versions** section.

9. Select the arrow near the **Restore** button, and then verify that you can restore the previous version either to the original location or to a custom location.
