**Results**: After completing this exercise you created a password policy that will affect the password settings for all domain users.

## Exercise 2: Testing Password Policy Settings

### Scenario

After configuring a more strict set of password policies you will then ask Jane Dow to test the policy settings.

### Task 1: Verify password settings

1. Switch to **SEA-CL1** and sign in as **Contoso\\Jane** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

2. When the message appears that indicates the user’s password must be changed before signing in, select **OK**.

3. In the New password box and the Confirm password box, type **Pa55w.rd12**, and then press **Enter**.

4. When the message displays that indicates that the new password does not meet the length, complexity, or history requirements of the domain, select **OK**. Type the old password, **Pa55w.rd**.

5. In the New password box and the Confirm password box, type **Pa55w.rd1234**, and then press **Enter**.

6. When a message displays that indicates that the password has been changed, select **OK**.

7. Sign out of **SEA-CL1**.

### Task 2: Attempt repeated sign-ins

1. Attempt to sign in to **SEA-CL1** as **Contoso\\Jane** with the incorrect password **password1**.

2. When a message displays that indicates that the password is incorrect, select **OK**.

3. Attempt again to sign in to **SEA-CL1** as **Contoso\\Jane** with the incorrect password **password1**.

4. When a message displays that indicates that the password is incorrect, select **OK**.
