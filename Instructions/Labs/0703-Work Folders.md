# Practice Lab: Work Folders

## Summary

In this lab you will learn how to configure Work Folders as a method of synchronizing files to provide access from multiple devices.

### Scenario

Members of the Marketing group often use multiple devices for their work. To help manage file access you decide to implement Work Folders. This allows for files to be stored in a central location and synchronized to each device automatically. To implement this solution, first you will install and configure the Work Folders server role on SEA-SVR1 and store the content in a shared folder named C:\\syncshare1. To enable the Work Folders for all marketing users, you configure a Group Policy Object to point to <https://SEA-SVR1.Contoso.com>. You have asked Bruce Keever to test the solution on a domain-joined device named SEA-CL1 and a stand-alone device named SEA-WS3. Bruce will validate synchronization and identify how synchronization conflicts are handled.
