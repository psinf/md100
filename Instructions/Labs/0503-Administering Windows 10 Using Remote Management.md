# Practice Lab: Administering Windows 10 Using Remote Management

## Summary

In this lab you will learn how to perform remote Windows administration using Remote PowerShell, Remote Desktop, and Windows Admin Center.

## Exercise 1: Administering Windows using Remote PowerShell and Remote Desktop

### Scenario

Your company is planning to open a new branch office. To manage the devices in the new branch office you need to use Remote PowerShell and Remote Desktop. You need to test remote administration by running remote PowerShell commands on SEA-SVR2 and you need to enable Remote Desktop on SEA-CL1.

### Task 1: Perform remote management using Windows PowerShell

1. Sign in to **SEA-CL1** as **Contoso\\Administrator** with the password: **Pa55w.rd**.

2. Right-click **Start**, and then select **Windows PowerShell**.

3. To view all of the services that are stopped on SEA-SVR2, in the Windows PowerShell window, type the following command, and then press **Enter**:

```
Get-Service -ComputerName SEA-SVR2 | Where-Object {$_.Status -eq "Stopped"}
```

4. To view the the content of the C:\\Program Files folder on SEA-SVR2, in the Windows PowerShell window, type the following command, and then press **Enter**:

```
Invoke-Command -ComputerName SEA-SVR2 -ScriptBlock {Get-ChildItem "C:\Program Files"}
```

5. To view the the System event log on SEA-SVR2, in the Windows PowerShell window, type the following command, and then press **Enter**:

```
Invoke-Command –ComputerName SEA-SVR2 –ScriptBlock {Get-EventLog –log system}
```

6. To determine if the WinRM service is running on SEA-SVR2, in the Windows PowerShell window, type the following command, and then press **Enter**:

```
Test-WsMan SEA-SVR2
```

   *Note: The output on SEA-SVR2 validates that the WinRM service is running and it is ready to receive WS-Management requests. If it was not configure, you would have needed to run **Winrm quickconfig** on SEA-SVR2.*

7. In the Windows PowerShell window, type the following commands, and then press **Enter** after each one:

```
Enter-PSSession SEA-SVR2
Get-command
Add-Content Remote.txt "Adding text to file on SEA-SVR2"
Exit-PSSession
```

### Task 2: Enable Remote Desktop

1. On **SEA-CL1**, select **Start**, and then select the **Settings** icon.

2. In **Settings**, select **System**.

3. On the **System** tab, select **Remote Desktop**.

4. Switch **Enable Remote Desktop** on.

5. In the Remote Desktop Settings window select **Confirm**.

6. On the Remote Desktop page, select **Advanced settings**.

7. Verify that Require computers to use Network Level Authentication to connect is selected. Also take note of the Current Remote Desktop Port, which is set to 3389.

8. Close the Settings page and close Windows PowerShell.

**Results**: After completing this exercise, you will have enabled and tested remote PowerShell and Remote Desktop.

## Exercise 2: Administering Windows using Windows Admin Center
